      <p>The legend of the Mexican eagle on a cactus comes from the Aztec people's quest to find their promised land, guided by their god Huitzilopochtli, who told them to build their city where they'd see an eagle devouring a serpent on a prickly pear cactus. This divine sign appeared on an island leading to the founding of their capital, Tenochtitlán (modern-day Mexico City) around 1325, and this image became the national symbol of Mexico.</p>
